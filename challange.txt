Coding Challenge – Personal Blog
Please organize, design, test, document and deploy your code as if it were going into
production, then send us a link to the hosted repository (Github, Gitlab or Bitbucket).
Your Mission
To create a simple blog website that allows users to add new articles and edit and
delete articles.
Product Requirements
• As a user, I should be able to add new articles and view, edit, and delete articles
that are already created.
• You will also have to develop the backend for the app that will handle all the blog
data.
• There should be a frontend application that has all the UI elements for the blog
and makes use of the backend API to consume data and save data.
Tech Requirements
• React js
• Node js (backend)
• Code Linter (eslint, prettier and style lint)
• Tests: Jest + react-testing-library / enzyme
We value quality over feature-completeness. It is fine to leave things aside provided you
call them out in your project’s README. The goal of this code sample is to help us
identify what you consider production-ready code. You should consider this code ready
for final review with your colleague, i.e. this would be the last step before deploying to
production.
Design
Please come up with a design for the page and implement it to fulfill the requirements
above. User experience should be kept in mind when designing.
